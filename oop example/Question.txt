Here is the coding challenge I mentioned:
 
FishTank.net 
I need a new C# class library (any .net version) to help me manage my fish tank. Don't worry about the UI: I will build that. 
The library should satisfy the following user stories and demonstrate your design, coding and testing abilities.
 


Here are the user stories:

A user should be able to add 3 types of fish to the tank (Gold fish, Angel fish, Babel fish) and name the fish

A user should be able to see how much food to put in the tank with a Tank.Feed()  method.

This should return the weight in grams of the total required fish food.

0.1g for each Gold  fish

0.2g for each Angel fish

0.3g for each Babel fish

A user should be able to save the data about the fish in the tank to an xml file

Ensure the design allows me to add more types of fish in the future without having to change the tank class.
 
 


I always tell candidates that this takes about an hour to complete.  I am happy that you take the same approach to this as you would do with any requirements we would send over but please let us know how many people and what seniority worked on it. Once I have gone through the test I like to have a 30 minute conversation with the person (or persons) to go through their code and ask questions.
